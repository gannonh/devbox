# Bundle Update Log

## 2026-06-29
* **Initialization**: Created the OKF bundle root, specs roadmap, ADR scaffold, and AGENTS.md guidance.
* **Indexing**: Linked the implemented [@gannonh/devbox npm package](/specs/2026-06-28-devbox-npm-package-design.md) spec into the bundle map.

## 2026-06-30
* **Release access**: Marked the release workflow and package metadata public for npm publishing.

## 2026-06-30 (2)
* **Release workflow redesign**: Switched to publish-first single-trigger (manual dispatch only) so a failed `npm publish` leaves no tag or release page. Stage both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in the version commit to avoid empty-commit failures on re-runs. Create a GitHub Release with `npx`/`npm install` instructions after publish succeeds. Reset repo version to `0.0.0` and deleted the dangling `v0.1.0` tag from the failed publish.
* **Branding scrub**: Removed `Kata Agents` from the shipped `templates/Dockerfile` header (now `devbox`) and neutralized `kata-agents` sample strings in test fixtures. Removed the now-resolved known-issue note from the spec. Spec historical provenance kept intact.
* **init guidance**: `init` now prints a post-create customization guide pointing at the repo-specific surfaces (`post-create.sh` hook, `devcontainer.json` ports/env, repo `.env` secrets, `provision.sh` agent switching, `Dockerfile` apt packages) before the boot prompt, rather than implying every generated file needs editing. Extended spec criterion 1 to cover the guide.
* **Agent skill**: Added `skills/devbox/SKILL.md` (a skill teaching coding agents how to use devbox), bundled it in the npm package (`files` now includes `skills`), and wired `init` to offer installing it to `.agents/skills/devbox/SKILL.md` (copies locally on `y`, skips in CI, always shows `npx skills add gannonh/devbox --skill devbox -y` for later install). Added spec criterion 15.
